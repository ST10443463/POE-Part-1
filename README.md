# POE-Part-1

The system runs with a friendly cyber bot, the user is introduced with an audio of "Hello, welcome to the cyber awareness bot, I am here to help you stay safe online".
The user has to enter their name and redirected to ask the bot any question.
The bot is limited to the amount of questions and only certain questions can be asked. If a question is asked the bot responds and an output is displayed. 
If the user decides to exit the program the bot will say goodbye and the program ends.

Questions like (how are you, what is phishing, what is cyber threats, what is safe browsing, what is a password, etc.) can be asked.
